* WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers.
* It is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web.
* It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.
* WebAssembly has huge implications for the web platform.
* It provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn’t have done so.
* WebAssembly is designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript.
* using the WebAssembly JavaScript APIs, you can load WebAssembly modules into a JavaScript app and share functionality between the two.
* This allows you to take advantage of WebAssembly's performance and power and JavaScript's expressiveness and flexibility in the same apps, even if you don't know how to write WebAssembly code.
